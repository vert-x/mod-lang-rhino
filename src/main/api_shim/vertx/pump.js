/** 
 * <p>
 * Pumps data from a {@linkcode ReadStream} to a 
 * {@linkcode WriteStream} and performs flow control
 * where necessary to prevent the write stream from getting overloaded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class read bytes from a {@linkcode ReadStream}
 * and write them to a {@linkcode WriteStream}. If data
 * can be read faster than it can be written this could result in the write
 * queue of the WriteStream growing without bound, eventually
 * causing it to exhaust all available RAM.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To prevent this, after each write, instances of this class check whether the
 * write queue of the WriteStream is full, and if so, the ReadStream is paused,
 * and a drainHandler is set on the WriteStream. When the WriteStream has
 * processed half of its backlog, the drainHandler will be called, which
 * results in the pump resuming the ReadStream.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class can be used to pump from any ReadStream to any WriteStream, e.g.
 * from an HttpServerRequest to an AsyncFile, or from NetSocket to a WebSocket.
 * </p>
