/**
 * Pumps data from a ReadStream to a WriteStream and performs flow control where necessary to
 * prevent the write stream from getting overloaded.
 *
 * Instances of this class read bytes from a ReadStream and write them to a WriteStream. If data
 * can be read faster than it can be written this could result in the write queue of the WriteStream growing
 * without bound, eventually causing it to exhaust all available RAM.
 * To prevent this, after each write, instances of this class check whether the write queue of the WriteStream
 * is full, and if so, the ReadStream is paused, and a WriteStreamdrain_handler is set on the WriteStream.
 * When the WriteStream has processed half of its backlog, the drain_handler will be called,
 * which results in the pump resuming the ReadStream.
